Description:
    This is a one-player shooter game in which the player (An Alien) is fighting against
    a Domo attack. The object of the game is for the alien to reach the other side of the board
    (cross the finish line), without getting hit. The alien is equipped with a spam gun which kills
    domos. A hit will remove the domos from the board. (Only one domo per bullet for now).

Controls:
    Alien (you) controls:
    i - up
    j - left
    k - down
    l - right

    space key - starts game
    q - shoots spam


Currently, the game will end when either you win or die. You start with 5 bullets. These run out fast! To refill, you
will have to pick up additional spam containers that appear on the board.
